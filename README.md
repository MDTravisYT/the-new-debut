*SONIC DEBUT*
============

The source code to the post-reset version of *SONIC DEBUT*. 

This was a project initially started in 2020 as a replica of the parallax demo showcased at the 1990 Tokyo Toy Show. It quickly expanded into its own project inspired off of this era of development.

Soon, others attempted to do the same. Suddenly, an influx of Sonic 1 beta hacks! *And* a real Sonic 1 prototype!

With this oversaturation of the concept, I scrapped this version of the hack's concept in 2023 in favor of a more arcade-based direction for the hack. That, unfortunately, didn't get too far before I lost motivation in the project entirely.

As for this version...
============
This is a modification of Sonic 1 stylized within its earlier stages of development, giving a unique twist on the game. Many prototype and concept materials are implemented here.
This hack features the following core changes:

 - Spinning Jump - Sonic doesn't instantly go into a ball when you jump. Press the action button mid-air to curl up and attack enemies
 - Health System - Sonic's health is no longer tied to rings. In fact, rings don't exist in this hack! There is a more standardized hit system here, starting off with 5 hit points. You lose a life if you lose all your hit points. Extra HP monitors are scattered around the levels.
 - New Level Layouts - As per usual, there's a new level layout. Not exactly new, but rather a twist on the existing ones.
 - New Sonic Sprites - It's like that one demo! Now you see why I wanted to change that.
